# Race Pace Comparison

This is a simple tool to compare race performances at different distances.

You can enter a number of best efforts at different distances. These efforts are converted to paces and graphed to help visualize whether these efforts are similar or different.

## How Are Calculations Made

The calculator converts each race performance to a set of equivalent paces, [using Pete Riegel's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Riegel).

The race times are first converted to seconds. Then, they're passed to the formula to calculate equivalent race times for each desired distance. Finally, the equivalent times are divided by miles or kilometers to give a race pace.

Each set of equivalent paces is graphed on the line graph.

Finally, the best and the worst efforts are identified. The equivalent paces for those two efforts are converted to seconds. The difference in seconds is divided by the best effort to calculate a percentage difference between the two paces.

A difference of less than 2.5% is considered normal. 2.5% to 5.0% is considered medium. And any difference above 5.0% is considered high.
